\section{Research questions} \label{seq:rq}

Considering the previous, this proposal seeks to investigate CJ as a SR method. First, we want to investigate if CJ can be applied to the field of speech research. More specifically, we want to know if CJ can be used to assess childrenâ€™s SI. Second, we seek to prove \textit{how valid, reliable and time efficient are the CJ methods to judge SI, compared to HJ}. More specifically, we seek to compare the HJ versus the dichotomous and ordinal versions of the CJ procedure (CJ-D and CJ-O, respectively).
