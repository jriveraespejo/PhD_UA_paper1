[check] SI measures comes from speech therapy, see literature there about OR process and if it is demanding


[check] you need an assessment that is much quicker, against OR.


[check] instead "psycho-physics" go for "psycho-linguistic"
Pim Leeveld - Speaking (1989) to learn abut psycho-linguistic


[check] How absolute holistic methods are done in other papers
Boonen et al (2021) and Faes et al (2021), integer between 0 and 100


[check] experimental setting
describe the slider for HJ


[check] slider on the left:
HJ actually is not independent (the next assessment is affected by the previous) 
solution so far was more in the sense of randomize the stimuli


[check] three parties in SI (for simuli section):
- speaker, add in introduction they have random effects
- listener, characteristics of them are also important, add in introduction they have random effects
- message (missing), e.g. quality of recording, makes intelligibility goes down. also speaking rate 
"the level of abstraction assumes the messages are equivalent."
they play a role together.
Should it be in the introduction, NO, just in the final paper or an extra discussion 


[] decision of 5 might be in Boonen (2021), or maybe we can decide to use 20 (proposal is not the bible)
see if we need to redesign the allocation of judges (Table 1 in my proposal)


[check] outliers vs reviewers:
dictatorial argument (does it work?)


[check] ABI out, only 3 child


[] HJ model, start simple (independent rating)
neural process of the subject cannot be controlled fully with statistics e.g. degree of aphasia
