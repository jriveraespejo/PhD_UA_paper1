	{Concluding remarks}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		%
		\item Research is filled with challenges, some are obvious, some are not (you: Duh!!)
		%
		\item Statistical models are not theory (you: so obvious again!!)
		%
		\item You should \alert{not} trust your statistical model, when no DAG is involved (me: how about that?!)
		%
		\item For \textcolor{blue}{explanation}, \alert{no amount of data} can save you, when no DAG is involved (me: booya?!)
		%
		\item For \textcolor{blue}{prediction}, sometimes a DAG can help (me: did you expect this one?!)
